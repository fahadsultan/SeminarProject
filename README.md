## Project Proposal
**Project Title.**
Temptare is attempt in Latin and this will be my attempt at game development, so I
think it is a fitting name.

**Background.**
All my life, I have been passionate about video games. Up until about high school,
I was only passionate about playing them, not creating them. However, after playing Skyrim for a
while, I became uninterested with the original game and began downloading mods. After exploring
mods for a while, I became bored with other people’s creations and desired to make my own. I
downloaded the Skyrim Creation Kit and customized Skyrim myself. Later in high school, I made
simple Javascript, HTML, and CSS two-dimensional video games loosely similar to Space Invaders.
Once I got to college, lack of free time and simply exploring other interests put my passion for
developing video games on a back burner. Now this year, with my graduation looming, I had been
extremely stressed out with my lack of direction in the industries I wanted to apply to for my first job
after college. However, Noelle Warner’s Purposeful Pathway, Early Access: My Experience In The
Video Game Industry, reignited my interest for making video games. One thing she mentioned was
that to even be considered when trying to get your foot in the door in the industry, it was necessary
to have a tangible project you could present when you interview or apply. Besides my final project
for CSC-344, Computer Graphics and Image Processing, I do not have any projects that I am proud
enough of to show future employers. Additionally, I would not really consider the project to be
a game. Also, the project was written in ThreeJS, but Mrs. Warner mentioned that most game
development companies utilize game engines, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and Blender. Going into
this class, I did not have any experience with such game engines, so my experience was lacking in
that department. Altogether, I am passionate about playing and developing video games, but I do not
have a project that I would actively want to show employers and I have a lot to learn about what goes
into constructing video games.

**Goal.** 
My proposed solution to those problems would be to construct a video game for the final
project. More specifically, I desire to make a Virtual Reality first-person shooter and environmental
lore video game in Unity. I know I will put in one hundred ten percent effort so at the end of this
project, I will be left something that I will be proud to show potential future employers. Additionally,
the project will give me insight in programming with C#, techniques for using game engine software,
and conceptual ideas behind game design. A stretch goal is implementing artificial intelligence into
my video game. Dr. Alvin informed me that he has books on artificial intelligence and am planning
on borrowing them from him. If adding artificial intelligence is feasible for my project in a reasonable
time period that does not detract from other aspects of the game, I would be highly interesting in
doing so.


**Methods.**
A technique I am hoping on being able to use is uploading the three-dimensional scan
of Riley Hall into Unity. I currently do not have access to the scan, but I reached out to admissions
to try and obtain it. Unfortunately, they did not have access to it, so they reached out to IT services,
who also did not have access to it. Admissions told me they also reached out to Communication
Studies, but I have not heard back, so I am planning on going in-person to their office in Furman
Furman CSC-475 Seminar in Computer Science
hall in order to follow-up. If I did gain access to the scan and was successfully able to load it into
Unity, the first-person shooter aspect of the game would be something harmless like paintball. A
key component of my proposed solution is using Unity. Unity has a collection of tutorials on their
website that aids users in their attempts to learn the software as well as construct games. Currently, I
have gone through the VR Development Pathway and learned in-depth how to set up VR projects,
how VR interaction works, building VR projects, and constructing scenes in Unity using prefabs and
other assets [1]. Another key component of my project is scripting. Currently, I have added scripts
that spawn projectiles on a key press as well as animate the projectiles. I used the book Introduction
to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development: From Concept to Playable Game with Unity and
C# by Jeremy Gibson Bond to learn the syntax for C# (Chapters 16 through 28) [2]. I used the online
tutorial on This Code Does This to walk me through projectile motion [3]. Additionally, I want to
explore Raycasting in C#, so I will read the Unity Documentation for it [4]. There will be many other
aspects of game development that I will need to research so I will continuously be adding references
to my project.

**Evaluation.** 
I will qualitatively evaluate the success of my project by playing the video game and
seeing how much enjoyment I gain from it. Therefore, the success of my project will be very abstract.
I will definitely get feedback from others who play my game as well.

**Dissemination.**
I will publish the program to either App Lab or Rift through the Meta Quest
Developer Hub, then I will post the code on GitHub. Alternatively, I will probably not publish my
final report as I do know who would want to read it. Also, I am planning on having a live demo of my
project at Furman Engaged.
